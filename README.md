## iPSC neuromuscular scRNAseq

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal is to investigate the processes of differentiation in motor neurons (MNs) derived from an iPSC model. Gene expression was assayed using single-cell RNA-sequencing (10x Genomics) and processed with CellRanger at each timepoint. Cells were collected from undifferentiated iPSC, and every 3 days until day 45. 

We aim to identify the regional identity and subtypes of iPSC motor neurons and transcriptomic (dis)similarity with native MNs in the fetal spinal cord.
